### Hey! Hey! Hey! Karl here :v:

A 21 years old IT student studying at West Visayas State University, a low-key kind of guy that have lots of dreams

At first many people will think of me as rude, but I'm just too shy to interact with new people. Given time you will eventually know that I'm not that kind of guy :laughing::laughing::laughing:. Want to travel around the world especially Japan :jp:. Mainly because I like to watch anime and also reads manga. But I also like the
environment there, peace and quiet, I'm kinda a nature loving guy. Likes to go to quiet places where my mind can be at ease.
